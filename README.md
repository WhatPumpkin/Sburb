# SBURB Engine

This is a slightly modified version of the SBURB engine. It has no affiliation with the original developers and is exclusively intended to provide a slightly more usable version of the engine in the modern day.

This project currently includes some minor fixes, improved instructions, all necessary files for the "social" dialog type, as well as a functional "production.bat" file for Windows users.

## Development

Ordinary users will only need to modify content in the "levels" directory and the "resources" directory. There is no need to touch any other files or directories, with the exception of the production files.

## Production

To create a production version if you are on Windows, execute "production.bat". It will construct a publishable ZIP file.
Otherwise, execute "production.sh", which will do the same but for non-Windows users.
