	<!-- This is the first half of a big optimization. Some people have a lot of
	trouble rendering big images, even if only a small part is being requested. While
	in development we often use the "full" image, but once we go into production we
	slice up all the big background and foreground images into a grid so that it's
	easier for end users' computer to pick out the parts we want.
	All the images except for the bottom-most and right-most ones are 500x500. I
	find that's a good compromise for performance/complexity. 
	
	utils/image_slice/ has a utility for doing this automatically. -->

	a very large amount of memory to use, so we keep the scaled down. I find 50%
	scale is a good compromise for performance/accuracy. However in sufficiently
	large rooms this is still too much, and 25% scale in necessary. This leads to
	a substantial sarcifice in hit-detection quality, so avoid big rooms!-->
