<!-- here we specify any sound effects used by the game. We specify all audio files
with an ogg-vorbis and mp3 version due to conflicts between browsers over
the HTML5 audio specification, that are unlikely to be resolved soon. 

As of this writing:
Firefox, Chrome, and Opera all support ogg files (team open standards)
Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer all support mp3 files (team copyright)

The first match that is found will be used. The others will never be loaded at all.
If you fail to include both versions, your application will simply fail 
to work in some browsers.
