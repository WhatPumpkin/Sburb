<!-- This file is used to bootstrap the rest of the application into existence.
Ideally it should be kept small and thin. While it can be renamed and moved,
keeping it here lets other code know how to start your application more easily.

name and version are used by the saving/loading API. Changing either will invalidate
a user's save files (this is good if you've changed anything).

description is a strictly aesthetic property that's handy for keeping track
of things.

scale specifies to what sized "grid" everything snaps to. In this case
scale='2' means everything snaps to a grid of 2x2 sqaures. This is desirable to
make everything line up nicely. Internally everything can have arbitrary positions,
they'll just be rendered in snapped positions.

char describes the start state of the game. The system will start in the
room this sprite is found in with that sprite under the user's control. It
must be a <character> or <fighter>. curRoom can also optionally be used to
override that part of this behaviour.

bgm specifies what song if any to play at the start of the game.

levelPath and resourcePath specify where all resource and level path specifications
should be relative to.-->
